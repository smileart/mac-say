Alice had sat on the bank by her sister till she was tired.
Once or twice she had looked at the book her sister held in her hand, but there were no pictures in it, "and what is the use of a book," thought Alice, "without pictures?"
She asked herself as well as she could, for the hot day made her feel quite dull, if it would be worth while to get up and pick some daisies to make a chain.
Just then a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.
